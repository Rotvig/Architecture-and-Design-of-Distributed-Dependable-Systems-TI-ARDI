\chapter{Solution}
This chapter will explain and discuss the chosen solution for implementing the system described in chapter \ref{chp:intro}.

\section{Discussion of architecture decisions}
The architecture is based on the Publish/Subscribe pattern. As shown in figure \ref{fig:basicArc} the dealer and players are decoupled with an Event Service. This decouples the clients and servers in both time, space and flow. By decoupling in space the participants do not need to know each other and it is therefore easier to replace a client or server implementation. Decoupling clients and servers in flow will ensure that they do not block each other. Decoupling in time will ensure that the participants do not need to be online at the same time. It is relevant to note that the time decoupling is difficult in a game scenario as multiple players will be forced to wait for a client. A specific game relevant time decoupling is therefore implemented in this solution.

Other patterns could also have been used in the solution. For example the Acceptor/Connector pattern could have been used for decoupling initialization of connection and the concrete service handling. By using the Acceptor/Connector pattern, implementing a new initialization strategy or processing strategy would have been easier. Also the Leader/Followers pattern could have been implemented to execute each publish of a message. Other patterns could therefore have been used and the overall design would have benefited from it.

This solution is though focused on the Publish/Subscribe pattern to drive the architecture and ensure a high degree of decoupling in both time, flow and space. 

\section{Deployment diagram}
The dealer, event service and players will all be deployed on different hosts. In the implementation the event service is called PubSubServer. The different entities will then communicate through a UDP socket using topic-based messages. The player and dealer will subscribe to specific topics through the PubSubServer. This is explained in figure \ref{fig:deploy}.

\myFigure{Deployment}{Deployment diagram }{fig:deploy}{1}

UDP is chosen as transport protocol because it is connectionless and faster than TCP. Also it allows for simple multicasting as multiple connection does not need to be setup for each message being sent.

\section{Design and implementation}
The software is divided into four different projects: Dealer, Player, PubSubServer and Shared. The Shared project contains classes used by both the Dealer, Player and PubSubServer. By using a shared project no code is copied and the game logic and Publish/Subscribe mechanism needed by both Player and Dealer can be placed in this project.

A simplified overview of the system is showed in a sequence diagram in figure \ref{fig:system_sq}. Here the context of the Player, PubSubServer and Dealer is described in a game scenario. Both Dealer and Player subscribes to a specific topic in the beginning. This topic is a table name. The Dealer then starts the game and the Player bets. When the Player has placed a Bet the Dealer deals out cards. After receiving the cards the Player chooses to stand and the Dealer sends the game result to the Player.

In the following sections the PubSubServer, Player and Dealer will be described in more depth.

\section{Design and implementation of the PubSubServer}
In addition to describing the client and server a small description of the PubSubServer is added. The publish subscribe server ensures a lower decoupling between clients and servers.

\myFigure{PubSub_class}{PubSubServer class diagram }{fig:pubSub_class}{1}

In figure \ref{fig:pubSub_class} the structure is shown. It consists of a PublisherService, SubscriberService, Subscribers, MessageService and a ConcurrentList class. 

The PublisherService listens for Publishers that wants to publish messages. When a message is received it checks whether it is a publish message. It then finds the subscribers based on the topic and passes the information on to the MessageService by invoking AddItemToList. If the message is not a publish message it is discarded by the PublisherService.

Message about clients who wants to subscribe or unsubscribe are handled by the SubscriberService which is listening for these types of messages and handles them. It will add  or remove subscribers to a dictionary. This dictionary is handled by the Subscribers class.

The Subscribers class provides an implementation of the dictionary that holds the subscribers endpoint and which topics they are interested in. Through the Subscribers class the SubscriberService can easily add and remove subscribers while the PublisherService can easily locate subscribers relevant for a topic. This class also handles the element of concurrency and introduces a lock.

MessageService ensures the time decoupling. It places messages on an implemented queue called concurrentList. The queue is custom implemented to handle concurrency. If a message can not be published to a subscriber at a given time it will save the message on the queue and publish the message at a later time. The subscriber will receive it when it is online again. Some messages includes timeouts - for example the dealer allows a window of 10 seconds to receive bets. If the 10 seconds has passed the subscriber will not receive the message when it comes back online because it is not relevant anymore.

\section{Design and implementation of client}
The client in this context is the Player. It uses classes from the Shared project and communicates with the PubSubServer. The Player subscribes to a specific table.

\myFigure{client_gui}{Two players' graphical user interface }{fig:client_gui}{1}

The implemented client is shown in figure \ref{fig:client_gui}. Here two different players are playing. A player can bet money when a game is started by the dealer and can also see the dealt cards. After betting the players can \emph{turn facedown card}, ask the dealer to \emph{hit me} and \emph{stand}. The figure shows a game that has finished and one player is \emph{bust} while the other chose to stand on 17.

\subsection{Class diagram}
The clients graphical user interface is developed in WPF. This is the MainWindow.

The MainWindow uses the Publisher and Subscriber classes which is in the Shared project as they are used by both the player and dealer. Through the Publisher class the MainWindow can publish messages based on the users action. For example if the user places a bet a message would be published. The MainWindow also subscribes to a specific table and receives messages from the dealer. This could for example be the dealt cards.

The Utils class is used by the client to get its own IP address. This method is also used by both player and dealer.

\subsection{Sequence diagram}
The behavior of the client is described in figure \ref{fig:client_sq}. The diagram is simplified by not writing all parameters being passed to methods, this is done to describe the context better and give a better overview. The diagram has three objects/classes from the client and shared project: MainWindow, Publisher and Subscriber. The PubSubServer is added as an entity in the diagram to describe the context better. The Publisher, Subscriber and PubSubServer communicates through sockets. The Subscriber runs in its own thread to asynchronously send ACKs to the PubSubServer. These ACKs are used for the time decoupling so that the PubSubServer knows if the message was received or not.

The sequence diagram is initialized by the user subscribing to a table. This results in the client subscribing to a specific topic on the PubSubServer. This topic would be a table name. At some time the PubSubServer will receive a message from the dealer that the game has started. The PubSubServer notifies the Subscriber about the event and the subscriber acknowledges the messages. It then invokes an event which the MainWindow is listening to, with the message game start. 

When the game has started the user makes a bet and the bet is published. When the bet is placed, the dealer will hand out cards. The PubSubServer will notify the Subscriber when the event occurs. The Subscriber then invokes an event and the MainWindow displays the cards to the user. 

The user can then choose to ask for more cards or stand. In this case the user choses to stand. This event is published to the PubSubServer. Then the PubSubServer receives a game over event and the Subscriber and the MainWindow is notified. The MainWindow displays the result of the game to the user.

\section{Design and implementation of server}
The server in this context is the dealer. It uses classes from the Shared project and communicates with the PubSubServer.

The graphical user interface of the server is shown in figure \ref{fig:server_gui}. The dealer can start a new game when players have joined the table. The dealer can also see its own cards and total value of these cards.  

\myFigure{server_gui}{A dealer's graphical user interface }{fig:server_gui}{1}

\subsection{Class diagram}
The server's graphical user interface is developed with WPF. This is called the MainWindow. Through the MainWindow the dealer can start a new game and see its cards. The dealer uses the Utils class to shuffle the cards. 

The dealer uses the Publisher class to for example publish the cards to the players. The dealer furthermore subscribes on for example bets coming from the players.

\subsection{Sequence diagram}
The behavior of the server is described in figure \ref{fig:server_sq}. Similar to the other sequence diagrams it is simplified by not writing all parameters being passed to the methods, this is done to describe the context and give an overview. The diagram has three objects/classes from the server and shared project: MainWindow, Publisher and Subscriber. The PubSubServer is added as an entity in the diagram to show how the PubSubServer relates to the classes. The Publisher, Subscriber and PubSubServer communicates through sockets.

When the dealer application is opened it automatically subscribes to a default topic/table. A dealer can also choose to subscribe to a different topic/table. The user then starts the game and a message is published that the game has started.

After the game has started players can bet. In this sequence diagram only one player has joined the table and only one bet event is received. After the dealer has received bets it hands out cards by publishing a message. 

The players can then choose to stand or ask for more cards. In the scenario described in the sequence diagram the event received is stand. The dealer then finishes the game and publishes game over to the player.
