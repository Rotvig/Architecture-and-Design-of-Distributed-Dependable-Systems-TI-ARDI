\chapter{Discussion of results}
In this project a distributed blackjack game has been developed that fulfils the requirements. The implementation uses the regular game rules.

In the implementation a dealer and player has been developed. Multiple players can join a game with a single dealer. The players and dealer only communicate through a publish/subscribe server. This allows for decoupling in both space, flow and time.

The decoupling in time was achieved by implementing a message queue on the publish/subscribe server. Furthermore time-outs were used so that players and the dealer did not have to wait too long for a disconnected player.

The low coupling between dealer and players makes it easier to modify and extend them independently. 

The publish/subscribe pattern was implemented with topic-based communication. This makes it easy to extend the current solution with new tables as a new table would just be a new topic. In the current solution only the topic \emph{table-1} is used.

Furthermore more patterns could have been used in the final solution such as the Acceptor/Connector pattern and the Leader/Followers pattern. The Acceptor/Connector pattern could have decoupled connection initialization and processing. Also Leader/Followers could have been used to process background tasks. But more patterns were not added because of the time constraint. 

The final implementation of the blackjack game is though easy to modify and extend as it uses the publish/subscribe pattern and is decoupled in both flow, space and time. Additionally it fulfils the requirements and is a well implemented solution for the given exercise.
